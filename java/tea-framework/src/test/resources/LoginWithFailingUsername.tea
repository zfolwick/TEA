#https://www.reddit.com  <-- commented out because iframes seems to be working differently than expected.

Test Case: Trying to login to reddit with a random username/password will fail.
#    click   xpath   //*[text() = 'Log In'] # Click login button <-- commented out because reddit uses iframes and the DOM for the loginUsername doesn't actually seem to render until a user clicks on it.  Strange.
    click   xpath   //*[@id='loginUsername']
    type    id      random
    click   id      loginPassword
    type    id      password
    click   xpath   //fieldset[5]/button
